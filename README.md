The dataset which is going to be used includes several vital pollutions like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, 
O3 and climate, temperature, humidity, wind speed and other factors involved in the project are going to 
develop a model to monitor air quality. The model aims to provide relevant information concerning the 
factors behind the emissions of poor air and possible impact on human health, especially the cardio
respiratory diseases. Thus, utilizing this dataset, the project wants to contribute to understanding the link 
between pollution and health by providing researchers, data scientists, and policymakers with information 
and reference data for monitoring and increasing air quality in industrialized and urban environments 
around the world.
